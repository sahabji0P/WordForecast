We love the world and the things in it We love the way cheetah runs We have a man of honor We should be rich We are teenagers so we will be rebellion We are iconoclast and fighter We believe in education We love everything We watch a movie every day We hate pollution We love the work of god We love the beauty of this world We adore the way people try solve hard things You are nothing but a blade of grass We will unleash a lot of prophecies and will bring down hordes of legions unto this earth to destroy you We love doing things in a peculiar way We love and hate probability. It is so stupid and fun at the same time We love the way software programs work We love your room
